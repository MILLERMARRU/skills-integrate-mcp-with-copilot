# MCP Integration Notes

This file was added as part of the "Integrate MCP with Copilot" exercise.

- MCP (Model Context Protocol) enables Copilot to interact with external tools and services.
- The .vscode/mcp.json file configures the GitHub MCP server for this project.

No code changes were made; this is for documentation and exercise validation only.
